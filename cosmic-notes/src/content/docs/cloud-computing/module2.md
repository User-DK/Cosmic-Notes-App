# Cloud Computing (NIST Model)

## 1. Introduction

This section introduces the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) definition of cloud computing, a crucial foundation for understanding the various cloud deployment models and service models discussed in Module 2.  The NIST model provides a standardized framework, crucial for clear communication and understanding within the industry and for students learning about cloud computing.  Understanding this model is essential for effectively navigating the complexities of cloud services and architectures.


## 2. Detailed Explanation

The NIST definition of cloud computing is a widely accepted standard.  It defines cloud computing as a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.  This definition highlights five essential characteristics:

* **On-demand self-service:** Consumers can provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
* **Broad network access:** Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
* **Resource pooling:** The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.  There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter).
* **Rapid elasticity:** Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
* **Measured service:** Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

These characteristics are further categorized into three service models (Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)) and four deployment models (private, public, community, and hybrid).  These models represent different ways to access and utilize cloud resources.


## 3. Practical Use Cases and Examples

* **IaaS:** A company uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 to host its web servers, paying only for the computing power they consume.  This is an example of IaaS in a public cloud.
* **PaaS:** A software development team uses Google App Engine to deploy and manage their web application, leveraging the platform's built-in services for database management and scaling. This is an example of PaaS in a public cloud.
* **SaaS:**  A business uses Salesforce for customer relationship management (CRM), accessing the application through a web browser.  This is SaaS in a public cloud.
* **Private Cloud:** A bank uses a private cloud to securely manage its internal applications and data, maintaining complete control over its infrastructure.


## 4. Open Source Discussions

While the NIST model itself isn't an open-source tool, many open-source projects align with and facilitate the implementation of the model. For instance, OpenStack is an open-source cloud computing platform that provides IaaS capabilities, allowing organizations to build and manage their own private or public clouds.  Other projects offer open-source components for various aspects of cloud management and orchestration.

They are developed collaboratively by organizations and individuals, ensuring neutrality and preventing any single vendor from controlling the technology.  In cloud computing, this translates to things like:

* **Data formats:**  Standards like JSON and XML define how data is structured and exchanged between different applications and services.  This enables easy integration of different cloud tools.
* **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):** Standards like REST and SOAP define how applications communicate and exchange data.  This ensures various cloud services can interact regardless of their underlying implementation.
* **Networking protocols:** Standards like TCP/IP and HTTP define how data is transmitted across networks.  This is fundamental to cloud connectivity and communication between different cloud components.
* **Virtualization technologies:** Standards like KVM and Xen ensure that virtual machines can run on different hypervisors. This promotes portability of applications between cloud providers.
* **Security protocols:**  Standards like TLS/SSL and OAuth 2.0 ensure secure communication and authentication in cloud environments.

These standards prevent vendor lock-in, allowing users to easily migrate their applications and data between different cloud providers without being tied to a proprietary system.


## 3. Practical Use Cases and Examples

* **Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage:** Both services support standard data formats like JSON and XML, allowing easy data transfer between them, even though they are from different vendors.
* **Using REST APIs to access various cloud services:** Developers can use consistent API calls to interact with different cloud services (e.g., Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3) regardless of the underlying technology.
* **OpenStack:** An open-source cloud computing platform that uses various open standards to provide a complete cloud infrastructure. This allows for customization and interoperability.

## 4. Open Source Discussions

Many open-source projects contribute to and benefit from open standards.  Examples include:

* **OpenStack:**  A comprehensive open-source cloud platform built upon various open standards.
* **Kubernetes:** A container orchestration system that utilizes open APIs and standards for managing containerized applications.
* **OpenVPN:**  An open-source implementation of the VPN protocol, providing secure network connectivity.

These tools are widely used in both academic and professional settings, contributing to a robust and collaborative cloud computing ecosystem.
